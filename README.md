# Teaching myself to code a neural net from the ground up

This project is entirely personal amusement. It resulted from an assignment to code a neural net and use SGD to recover a simple image which at the time didn't
work out too well due to a lack of time. I am intending to implement most of the things in Goodfellow et al.'s Deep Learning and then maybe continue with something
else.
